# Inspiration
The P2PKit, the Microsoft cognitive APIs and Logitech's C922 webcam inspired us to build this app.

# What it does
On the one side, it registers people arriving at an event by taking a picture of them, analyzing the picture to extract the main features of the person (age, gender, color of clothes, wearing glasses or not etc.) and sends these back to the mobile device. This is used to identify the person at the event. On the other side, the users can set up tags in the app to describe themselves and the people they would like to meet during the event. Finally, when one person gets in close range of one of the people he/she wants to meet, they get a notification and the description of this person.

# How we built it
In less than 24 hours, without getting much sleep but still having great FUN :)

# Challenges we ran into
Setting up the P2PKit API which uses new Bluetooth technology to communicate the relative position, taking a picture which would allows us to get the correct information from Microsoft's cognitive API.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We did it!

# What we learned
Teamwork, working with new APIs, new technology.

# What's next for CloseBy
Giving the users more flexibility in managing the meetings, finding a way to locate more precisely the people they want to meet.
